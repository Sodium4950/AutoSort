Dear Users,

I regret to inform you that AutoSort will be shutting down soon due to insufficient user engagement. While you can continue to use AutoSort in its current state, there will be no further updates or development.

I appreciate your support, but regrettably, I am unable to continue its development. If the user engagement increases in the future, I may revisit this decision, last release available here https://github.com/Sodium4950/AutoSort/releases/tag/v1.1.
If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me at moustafaabdelgafar@gmail.com .
Thank you,
Moustafa
